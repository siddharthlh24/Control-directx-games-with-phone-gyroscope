# Control-directx-games-with-phone-gyroscope
This allows games to be controlled through mobile's accelrometer or gyroscope via UDP
This project was a collaboration between me and Sourav Karjee.


This app makes use of UDP to send sensor data.
The python script itself is universally usable in all DirectX games but has been specifically set to emulate arrow keys.
The phone and pc need to be on the same network and host IP and port must set accordingly.
Enjoy !
